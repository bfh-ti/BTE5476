    "In our previous lecture we looked at how to use an instantaneous phase reversal in a sinusoidal carrier to transmit a synchronization pulse. In that case, a single phase reversal was used to convey timing information (e.g. a \"start\" signal); but, if we knew in advance when one or more phase reversals were going to happen, their presence or absence would correspond to one bit of information each. This is the idea behind BPSK communications."

    "The user data must first be converted to a binary stream suitable to BPSK trasmission and this is performed by a _data link layer_ module. Here we assume that the user data is a sequence of 8-bit bytes, typically a sequence of ASCII characters. The data link layer defines an _escape byte_ (or sync word), a special 8-bit value that will never appear in the data payload; the transmitted bistream is built as follows:\n",

    " * first, a synchronization burst of several sync words is sent\n",

Differential encoding and decoding is easily performed via a XOR operation."
