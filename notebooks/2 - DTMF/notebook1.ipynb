    "DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) is a signaling protocol used to transmit simple numeric information over the frequency band provided by analog telephone lines, that is, between 300 Hz and 3400 Hz. When you use the keypad of an analog phone such as the one shown on the right, the sequence of dialed digits is transmitted to the phone company's switches in the form of audible _dial tones_. Today, cell phones and office phones are directly connected to digital networks and therefore no longer use DTMF for dialing.

In this notebook we will implement our own digital DTMF algorithms but, before anything else, let's review the relationship between the DTMF frequency values in Hz as specified by the standard and the digital frequencies that we will need to use in discrete time.

    "## State machines\n",

    "Most digital signal processing applications need to work in real time, that is, they need to process an input stream of samples continuously, one sample at a time. Last week, for instance, we saw how to implement filters as Python *classes* so that a filter could be called repeatedly on individual samples; using classes allowed the filter to preserve the contents of its delay blocks across calls (that is, the filter's internal *state* was persistent).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In more complex systems that implement some decision logic, the processing algorithm needs to behave differently according to the *current* properties of the input; for instance, when decoding DTMF, we want to look at the frequency content in tone intervals but do nothing for the silence gaps. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common **design pattern** in this case is a *state machine*; every time a new sample arrives:\n",
    " * we first perform the required pre-processing steps (e.g. compute the local energy)\n",
    " * we then apply a different set of processing steps that depend on an internal *state*\n",
    " * finally, we check if we neet to switch to a different state for the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we want to isolate the tone segments in a DTMF signal, we can use a machine with three states:\n",
    " 1. waiting for the input power to increase\n",
    " 2. checking that the power increase lasts long enough to indicate a tone\n",
    " 3. waiting for the power to decrease and signal the end of the tone\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example that produces a segmentation of a DTMF signal based on a user-defined power threshold:"

Once you have it working, you can try it with the set of test signals available in the data directory of this notebook. The test signals contains some of the typical impairments that a real-world decoder has to face: noise, detuning, timing issues, attenuation. How many of them can your decoder get right? Find out by running the following cell, and don't worry if there are mistakes, some of the test signals are really difficult!)"
